# SharpCorp

Welcome to the ultrasecretive R&D vault of SharpCorp — the outfit rumored to be quietly cornering every interesting idea under the sun. Our modest, perfectly reasonable long‑term objective: global market domination, tasteful hoarding of cash and shiny metals, and coffers so vast even Uncle Scrooge would feel a tiny twinge of professional jealousy. Totally normal stuff.

What are we building? We never say. If you have to ask, you’re either not cleared… or you’ve already signed the NDA and forgot. Expect occasional hints, impeccable commit hygiene, and a suspicious level of operational efficiency.

If you’re reading this, you’ve seen nothing. If you haven’t, we’re delighted you like what you didn’t see.
